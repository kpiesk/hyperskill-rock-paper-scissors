# hyperskill-rock-paper-scissors
### My Rock-Paper-Scissors project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #7

**About:** A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against a computer. The program also allows to play a more advanced version of the game, for example, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. The user just needs to enter the options of the game separated by commas. The program then determines the rules of the game (which option loses against which ones).
