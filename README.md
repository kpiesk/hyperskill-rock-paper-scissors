# hyperskill-rock-paper-scissors
### My Rock-Paper-Scissors project as part of the Hyperskill Jetbrains Academy Python Developer course.

**Project Number:** #7

**About:** A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against a computer. First, the user is prompted to enter their name, and then the program checks whether there is a record for the user with the same name in a rating.txt file; if yes, then the program uses their score as a starting point for calculating the score in the current game. The user can find out their score by typing '!rating'. The program also allows to play a more advanced version of the game, for example, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock. The user just needs to enter the options of the game separated by commas. The program then determines the rules of the game (which option loses against which ones). The program always checks whether the user's input is correct. The game is playable indefinitely unless the user enters '!exit'.
